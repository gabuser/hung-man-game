# hung man game 

just a simple project I've made and casually bumb into on my computer by accident
you might modified if you wish the words.txt file.

### how to run? 
make sure to install the newer python versions to make it work without any problems

run in the terminal or any editor you like the following command:
>python humgman.py 
all the libs used on this project are from the standard python, so you don't have to install any.

For Portuguese speakers, do not use accents, as it may cause unexpected behavior.
also, I forgot to mention: try to not put words that repeats itself, because it donsen't accept duplicate words.
one day i will fix it

case this dosen't work try: 

>python3 humgman.py
